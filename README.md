Breath OS
==========
By Alexander Liu

The Breath OS is a new GNU/Linux OS built from source codes. It isn't like any other Linux destros because you have 100% control over it.

The Breath OS is still under development before releasing. But here I would like to share that how I made Breath OS step by step.


How was Breath OS built?
------------------------

Breath OS is created from a basic tutorial of ![LFS 8.0 with Systemd](www.linuxfromscratch.org].

But the linuxfromscratch.org doesn't provide a live CD for building LFS anymore after LFS version 6.2 . So I created a new environment for building LFS. You can download my environment and build your system from source codes.


Downloads
---------

#### 1. LFS-8.0-systemd-manual-all-pkgs.tar.gz
This includes all source codes of packages which LFS-8.0-systemd needs. And it comes with a PDF/HTML manual for building your LFS system!

If you can read Chinese, you can visit [here](http://www.cnblogs.com/spaceship9/p/6526887.html) to read some of my experiences about building a new OS.

#### 2. LFS-8.0-systemd-tools-compiled

This includes all the tools compiled for building the new OS.

Note: The tools are only for building the OS and they are the base for building a new OS. But it could be deleted after the new OS was built.

#### 3. My whole environment for building the a new OS

I created a Virtual Machine based on Ubuntu16.04 64bit. And I installed all required packages for building LFS. In the Virtual Machine, I attached all `LFS-8.0-systemd-manual-all-pkgs.tar.gz` and I wrote a tutorial inside of the Virtual Machine. You can use Virtualbox to import it.
